Two dinstict task: 1. action localization and 2. action classification


Evaluate the model independendly on each task

action classification replace the RPN proposals with the ground true labels

assume perect classifiation by converting all class labels into a single one 
to evaluate only the person localization performence.

compare the model with other state of the art models


4.1 Data set

labels bounding boxes for each person and action 

performence is evaluate unsing frame-level mean average precison (frame-AP) at
IOU threashold of 0.5.

4.2

evaluate the head classify by give it the ground Truelabel (GT) gives upperbound
for action classification of the network 



Only small improvment by using GT box.
This is an indiation that the network is able to learn a good representation for
person detection.

Compare the I3D head with the Action Transformer. Use the AT with GT Boxes leads 
to an increase of 5%.(AT has 2.3M less parametert as I3D head so improvment is
not from Model capacity.

The performence of the AT drops if only R = 64 region problsels install of 300.



4.3 localization performence (action agnostic) (not depend on the action)


The I3D head with RPN boxes 93% mAP at 0.5 IOU.

Action Transformer with low-resolution and high-resolution

low-resolution poorly with 78% 
high-resolution better but still 87% 


4.4 overall performence

the AT head 24.4 to I3D 20.5

compined  is 24.9
