Two dinstict task: 1. action localization and 2. action classification


Evaluate the model independendly on each task

action classification replace the RPN proposals with the ground true labels

assume perect classifiation by converting all class labels into a single one 
to evaluate only the person localization performence.

compare the model with other state of the art models
