3. Action Transformer Network

detect all persons and classify all actions in keyframe

head and trunk similar to Faster R-CNN object detection

base (trunk) uses 3D convolutional to genrate features and region proposals for
the people in the Image.

Head uses the feature associated with each proposal to regress a tighter
bounding box and action.

The RPN and bounding box regress are action agnostic.





3.1 Base (trunk) network architecture

The input of the a T-frame is extracted of the clip usally 64 
which encodes 3 s around the keyframe.
